Monitor of Large Players: An Inside Look from the Most Influential Market Participants

Monitor of Large Players is your personal radar that tracks the actions of the biggest and most influential participants in the crypto market in real time.

How it works:
In the world of cryptocurrencies, "whales" refer to owners of huge wallets—institutional investors, funds, and experienced traders whose trades can move the market. Our application tracks their transactions on leading platforms and blockchains, analyzes behavioral patterns, and instantly notifies you of significant activities.

What you get:

🔔 Instant notifications

Alerts about large buy or sell orders

Signals of asset accumulation by large players

Warnings about transfers between wallets

📊 Automatic trade copying (optional)

Customizable strategies for following verified traders

Smart filter—copy only well-reasoned trades, not random transfers

Risk control with flexible limit settings

Why it's effective:
Large players possess information, resources, and influence that ordinary investors don't have. Their actions often foreshadow significant market movements. Now you have the opportunity to see their cards and make more informed decisions.

Safety and transparency:

We do not require access to your funds

All data comes from public blockchain sources

Verified history of successful traders with proven results

Who it's for:
✅ Beginner investors who want to learn from the best
✅ Experienced traders seeking additional signals
✅ Anyone tired of market noise who wants to see real fund movements

Important to understand: Following large players is not a profit guarantee, but a powerful analytical tool. The market is volatile, and even major participants sometimes make mistakes. We provide you with information, and you make informed decisions.
